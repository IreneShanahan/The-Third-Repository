            <p> Itâ€™s a heart rate and glucose monitor that compares against the food diary and alerts the user to any suspect spikes in either. The user has an app on their smartphone in which they input their food intake into the food diary after each meal. They wear a wristband that synces with the app on their phone. That wristband takes a continuous glucose and heart rate reading and updates the app.

              <p> A food diary is a record of foods that you eat on a meal-by-meal, daily, or weekly basis. You can include nutritional or other dietary information, organize and track foods by food group. This lets you monitor know what, when, and how often you eat, as well as where your nutrition needs lie.

              <p> The wristband monitors the heart rate continuously sending data to the app on your smart phone. A heart rate monitor has become a feature that separates serious fitness trackers from basic step counters. Your heart rate is a telling metric, providing insight into how hard your heart has to work both while resting and during exercise. For serious athletes and people who want to train using target heart rate zones, a heart rate monitor's accuracy makes a huge difference.
